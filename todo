-> make a task #11, different tempo and period for task #5 to make a pre-post test
-> make a task #12, tempo-adaptive periodic
V make a task #13, randomly tempo-changing periodic pre-post test

Should we show graphically the data to participants during preparation? Makes the task more intuitive?

Do one re-calibration

How many pre-post tests?
V 1-3
V visual
